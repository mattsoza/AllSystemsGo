# BioRPG

## Summary
Spring 2023 final project for CMS.590, computer games. This is the team's first time using Godot, an open-source game engine with support for a GDScript, a langauge with syntax similar to python.

The game's premise is that you are a scientist in the 1920's who has been shrunk down and placed into the body of an individual who is having health problems, particularly of the lungs. As you explore the human body and talk to cells, viruses, bacteria and more, you learn about what causes disease, how the body protects itself, and how it can sometimes fail to protect itself!

## To run
This project requires Godot 4.x in order to run. If you would like a standalone version, please follow [Godot's documentation for exporting projects](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/index.html).
